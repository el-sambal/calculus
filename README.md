# Calculus I (for CS), support lecture

This repository contains the slides for the support lecture for **Calculus I (for CS)**, organized by Study Association Cover. This is a (very) dense recap lecture, which is not officially part of the course.

Previous versions of these slides have been used for the courses Calculus for Computing Science and Calculus for Artificial Intelligence (which at the time were almost identical), but the current version is only for Computing Science students; it has not been synced with the AI course.
