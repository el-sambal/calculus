# calculus

These are the slides for the support lecture for Calculus for Computing Science and Calculus for Artificial Intelligence.

It is hoped that the slides are of good use to you and your classmates.

Please notice that I am (at the time of writing this) not a Teaching Assistant. This is an unofficial support lecture organised by Study Association Cover, and these slides are not official, nor has the lecturer reviewed them or approved of them.

If you have *any* suggestion to improve these slides, please contact me! (I won't put my email address here but if you are at RUG, you probably know a way to find me or deduce my email address.)

Of course, you are also allowed to play around with the LaTeX source code yourself. You are also allowed to make your own copies of the source code and improve the slides. Basically you can do anything you want, provided you don't remove the license or copyright notice. (for more info, see License)

Once again, I would be extremely happy with *any* suggestion for improvement! Thank you for looking at these slides! ;)
