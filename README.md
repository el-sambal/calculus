# calculus

These (CALCULUS.pdf) are the slides for the support lecture for Calculus for Computing Science and Calculus for Artificial Intelligence.

It is hoped that the slides are of good use to you and your classmates.

Please notice that I am (at the time of writing this) not a Teaching Assistant. This is an unofficial support lecture organised by Study Association Cover, and these slides are not official, nor has the lecturer reviewed them or approved of them.

If you have any suggestion to improve these slides, please contact me! (I won't put my email address here but if you are at RUG, you probably know a way to find me or deduce my email address.)

Of course, you are allowed (and in that case I'd be honored) to make your own copy of the LaTeX source code and improve the slides (provided you don't violate the License). You can also just share the pdf.

Once again, I would be extremely happy with any suggestion for improvement! Thank you for looking at these slides! ;)
