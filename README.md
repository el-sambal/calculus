# calculus

These (CALCULUS.pdf) are the slides for the support lecture for Calculus for Computing Science and Calculus for Artificial Intelligence.

It is hoped that the slides are of good use to you and your classmates.

Please notice that I am not a Teaching Assistant. This is an unofficial support lecture organised by Study Association Cover, and these slides are not official, nor has the lecturer reviewed them or approved of them.

If you have any suggestion to improve these slides, feel free to contact me.
